# Changelog

All notable changes to the `nsis` crate are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-09

### Changed

- Recorded ATRAPS LLC as copyright holder and added a `NOTICE` file. No functional change.
- Dropped the deprecated `authors` field and repointed `repository` at the organisation.
- Refreshed transitive dependencies (`cargo update`); no direct dependency changed version.
- Publishing now uses crates.io trusted publishing instead of a stored registry token.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- `NsisInstaller::builder()` returning a `NsisInstallerBuilder` for configuring
  a parse, plus `NsisInstallerBuilder::max_decompressed_size()` to set the
  decompression budget. `NsisInstaller::from_bytes()` is retained as a
  convenience that parses with default limits.
- `NsisInstaller::max_decompressed_size()` accessor and the
  `NsisInstaller::DEFAULT_MAX_DECOMPRESSED_SIZE` constant (64 MiB).
- `decompress::DecodeLimit`, an enum that makes the three real decode intents
  explicit: `Exact(n)` (known size — stop at `n`, ignore trailing input),
  `Capped(n)` (unknown size — decode to end-of-stream, error if it exceeds
  `n`), and `Truncate(n)` (unknown size — decode to end-of-stream, stop at `n`
  without error). Includes a `size()` accessor.
- `Error::OutputTooLarge { limit }`, returned when a `Capped` stream would
  expand past its budget.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** decompression budgets are now configurable instead of guessed.
  The previous `max(compressed_size * 10, 64 MiB)` heuristic — used for embedded
  files, the solid file-data stream, and uninstaller overlays — is replaced by a
  single budget threaded from `NsisInstaller::builder().max_decompressed_size()`.
- **Breaking:** `decompress::decompress_block` now takes a single `limit:
  DecodeLimit` argument in place of the previous `max_output: usize` and
  `expected_size: Option<usize>` parameters.
- **Breaking:** `decompress::{decompress_deflate, decompress_bzip2,
  decompress_lzma}` now take `limit: DecodeLimit` in place of their
  `max_output` / `expected_size` parameters.
- **Breaking:** `Error` gained the `OutputTooLarge` variant; exhaustive matches
  on `Error` must handle it.
- Over-budget extracted artifacts (files, uninstallers) now fail with
  `Error::OutputTooLarge` instead of being silently truncated, so callers no
  longer receive partial data reported as success.
- The LZMA decoder is now bounded *during* decompression via a size-limited
  writer rather than decoding fully and truncating afterward.

### Fixed

- Extract LZMA non-solid embedded files correctly. Per-file LZMA streams carry
  no stored uncompressed size and terminate with an end-of-stream marker;
  passing a fixed expected size made `lzma-rs` reject the marker
  (`"Expected unpacked size of N but decompressed to M"`), so every file in
  affected installers was dropped. Unknown-size streams now rely on the EOS
  marker.
- Apply the same end-of-stream fix to the uninstaller-overlay decode path,
  which carried the identical latent defect.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- Handle packed NSIS installers whose `FirstHeader` is structurally valid but
  not 512-byte aligned relative to the PE overlay, as seen in Adload samples.
- Report out-of-bounds `EW_EXTRACTFILE` payloads as iterator errors instead
  of exposing malformed file records as empty extracted files.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- `NsisInstaller::format_entry(&Entry) -> String` for rendering an opcode
  mnemonic plus decoded parameters as a script-like line.
- `NsisInstaller::format_entry_params(&Entry) -> String` for consumers that
  need reusable opcode-aware parameter formatting without reimplementing the
  string/variable/jump decoding rules.
- `NsisInstaller::script_analysis()` for script-level control-flow analysis,
  including roots, functions, basic blocks, edges, entry-to-block mapping, and
  diagnostics for invalid targets.
- Symbol-aware formatting via `format_entry_with_analysis()` and
  `format_entry_params_with_analysis()`, which annotate jump and call targets
  with names from `ScriptAnalysis`.

### Changed

- The `dump` example now uses the crate-provided instruction formatting API.
- The `dump` example uses script analysis symbols when rendering control-flow
  targets.
- Opcode metadata now matches NSIS operand layouts more closely for stack,
  UI, execution, registry, and file I/O instructions.

### Fixed

- `EW_PUSHPOP` formatting now treats `param0` as a variable for `Pop` and as a
  string for `Push`, preventing variable IDs from being decoded as offsets into
  unrelated strings such as `ProgramFilesDir`.
- Corrected high-level accessor layouts for `ShellExecOp` and `RegDelete`.
- Corrected several opcode parameter layouts and types, including
  `EW_GETFULLPATHNAME`, `EW_INTOP`, `EW_INTFMT`, `EW_FINDWINDOW`,
  `EW_SENDMESSAGE`, `EW_GETDLGITEM`, `EW_SHELLEXEC`, `EW_DELREG`, `EW_FOPEN`,
  `EW_FSEEK`, and `EW_FINDFIRST`.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- `fmt::Display` implementations for the public diagnostic enums so
  consumers no longer need `format!("{:?}", ...)`:
  - `CompressionMethod` → `"deflate"`, `"bzip2"`, `"lzma"`, `"none"`.
  - `CompressionMode` → `"solid"`, `"non-solid"`.
  - `StringEncoding` → `"ANSI"`, `"Unicode"`, `"Park"`.
  - `NsisVersion` → `"NSIS 1"`, `"NSIS 2"`, `"NSIS 3"`, `"NSIS Park"`.
  - `RegValueType` → `"REG_SZ"`, `"REG_EXPAND_SZ"`, `"REG_BINARY"`,
    `"REG_DWORD"`, `"REG_MULTI_SZ"`, `"REG_UNKNOWN(N)"`.
- `Callback` enum (`src/installer/callback.rs`) covering the ten
  common-header callback slots (`OnInit`, `OnInstSuccess`,
  `OnInstFailed`, `OnUserAbort`, `OnGuiInit`, `OnGuiEnd`,
  `OnMouseOverSection`, `OnVerifyInstDir`, `OnSelChange`,
  `OnRebootFailed`). Provides:
  - `Callback::ALL` — all ten variants in common-header order.
  - `Callback::name()` — canonical NSIS script name (e.g. `".onInit"`).
  - `Callback::index()` — slot index (`0..10`) into the common-header
    callback array.
  - `fmt::Display` — delegates to `name()`.
- `NsisInstaller::callback(Callback) -> Option<usize>` — generic
  accessor that returns the entry index for any callback slot,
  complementing the existing per-callback `on_init()` / `on_inst_success()`
  / etc. methods.
- All standard `EW_*` opcode constants are re-exported at the crate root,
  so upstream analysis crates can match opcode numbers without importing
  the internal `opcode` module.
- `Section::contains_entry(usize) -> bool` — returns `true` when the
  given entry index falls within the section's `[code, code+code_size)`
  range. Treats negative `code`/`code_size` as zero, so consumers no
  longer need defensive `.max(0)` casts before doing range checks.
- `NsisInstaller::section_contains_entry(section_idx, entry_idx) -> bool`
  — convenience wrapper that resolves the section by index and applies
  `Section::contains_entry`.

### Changed

- The clippy panic-prevention lint set
  (`unwrap_used`, `expect_used`, `panic`, `arithmetic_side_effects`,
  `indexing_slicing`) is now declared `deny` in
  `Cargo.toml [lints.clippy]`, so the policy holds regardless of the
  consuming workspace. Previously only `missing_docs` and `unsafe_code`
  were denied (in `src/lib.rs`).
- Triage and clearance of the 310 lint violations exposed by the new
  policy. Affected files (paths relative to `src/`):
  `addressmap.rs`, `decompress/{bzip2,lzma,mod}.rs`,
  `header/{blockheader,commonheader,firstheader,mod}.rs`,
  `installer/{analysis,files,nsisinstaller}.rs`,
  `nsis/{ctlcolors,entry,langtable,page,section}.rs`,
  `opcode/mod.rs`,
  `strings/{ansi,mod,park,unicode}.rs`,
  `util.rs`.
  Patterns applied:
  - `&[u8]` indexing → `.get(...)` with `Option`/`Result` propagation.
  - Offset/size arithmetic → `checked_add` / `checked_sub` /
    `saturating_*`.
  - `.unwrap()` / `.expect()` on parse steps → `?`-propagated
    `Error` arms.
  Tests retain the convenience of `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic` via the
  `cfg_attr(test, allow(...))` escape hatch in `src/lib.rs`.

### Fixed

- Carried forward from in-progress work on `main`: park opcode mapping
  correction and uninstaller data extraction (see commit `1778513`).
